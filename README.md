# **HN-Transformer**

## 📌 **Definition**

This project implements a Transformer model from scratch using PyTorch, following the architecture introduced in **"Attention Is All You Need"** (Vaswani et al., 2017). The model includes:

    Positional Encoding
    
    Scaled Dot-Product Attention
    
    Multi-Head Attention
    
    Encoder-Decoder Stacks
    
    Tokenization (SentencePiece)

Transformers are the backbone of modern Large Language Models (LLMs) like *GPT and BERT*, enabling efficient parallel processing and long-range dependency modeling.

## 🚀 **Use Cases**

This implementation can be used for:

    Machine Translation (e.g., English to French)
    
    Text Summarization
    
    Question Answering
    
    Chatbot Development
    
    Text Generation

## 🎯 **Proposal**

This project aims to:

    Provide a clear, modular implementation of Transformers for educational purposes.
    
    Demonstrate self-attention mechanisms and positional encoding.
    
    Serve as a foundation for fine-tuning on custom datasets.
    
    Highlight the importance of ethical AI safety in LLMs.

## 💪 *Key Strengths*

    ✅ From-Scratch Implementation – No reliance on high-level libraries (e.g., Hugging Face).
    ✅ Modular Design – Encoder, Decoder, and Attention layers are reusable.
    ✅ Efficient Tokenization – Uses SentencePiece for subword tokenization.
    ✅ GPU Support – Optimized for CUDA acceleration.
    ✅ Customizable – Adjustable hyperparameters (heads, layers, dimensions).

## 🎨 *What It’s Designed For*

This model is designed for:

    🔹 Learning – Helps understand how Transformers work under the hood.
    🔹 Experimentation – Can be extended with different attention variants.
    🔹 Small-Scale NLP Tasks – Suitable for research and prototyping.

## ⚠️ **Areas for Improvement**

### 1. Need for **RLHF** (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback)
Why? The model may generate biased, incorrect, or harmful outputs based on its training data.

Solution: Implement RLHF (like ChatGPT) to align outputs with human preferences.

### 2. Ethical AI Safety Concerns
Why? If trained on unfiltered or manipulative text, the model could produce:

    Misinformation
    
    Toxic language
    
    Biased responses

It was originally design to provide advice on human values so will be trained on books such as :

    Art of war by Sun Tzu
    
    Laws of Human Nature
    
    Meditation by Marcus

Solution:

    Fine-tune with safety filters
    
    Implement content moderation
    
    Use curated datasets

### 3. Other Improvements Needed
   
🔸 Better Masking Handling – Optimize decoder attention masking.

🔸 More Efficient Training – Add gradient checkpointing & mixed precision.

🔸 Evaluation Metrics – Add BLEU, ROUGE for NLP tasks.

🔸 Deployment Readiness – Add ONNX export & quantization support.

📂 How to Use

Install dependencies:

```python
pip install torch sentencepiece datasets
```

Train the model:

```python
from model import Full_Transformer
model = Full_Transformer(src_vocab_size=800, tgt_vocab_size=800, ...)
```

Tokenize inputs:

```python
tokens = tokenizer.encode("Hello, world!")
```

Generate text:

```python
output = model.generate(input_ids)
```
